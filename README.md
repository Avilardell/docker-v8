# V8

From https://developers.google.com/v8/:

> V8 is Googleâ€™s open source high-performance JavaScript engine, written in C++ and used in Google Chrome, the open source browser from Google, and in Node.js, among others.

# Usage

```
$ docker pull andreburgaud/d8
```

## V8 Enhanced Shell

```
$ docker run --rm -it andreburgaud/d8 shell
Starting d8 with the following parameters: --allow-natives-syntax --harmony-shipping
--harmony-do-expressions --harmony-class-fields --harmony-static-fields --harmony-array-flatten
--harmony-numeric-separator
Use quit() or Ctrl-D (i.e. EOF) to exit the d8 Shell
V8 version 6.8.0 (candidate)
d8>
```

* The default V8 shell is wrapped with `rlwrap` (https://github.com/hanslub42/rlwrap) to enhance the experience with the REPL (e.g. use arrow keys to recall previous/next lines).

* The `harmony` options are automatically injected via the `entrypoint.sh` script.

* Additional V8 options in addition to the `harmony` ones can be passed at the command line:

```
$ docker run --rm -it andreburgaud/d8 shell --dump-counters
```

### Using Multiline

When starting the d8 container with command `shell`, as follow:

```
$ docker run --rm -it andreburgaud/d8 shell
```

You also have the ability to write statements across several lines, by ending lines with a `\` (backslash):

```
d8> function f(n) { \
    print(n); \
}
undefined
d8> f('TEST');
TEST
undefined
d8>
```

### What is Harmony?

When ECMAScript 4 (ES4) was abandoned in 2008, some of its features were rolled into a project codenamed ECMAScript Harmony. ES6 later renamed ES2015 was the first "ECMAScript Harmony" specification and is also known as "ES6 Harmony". The V8 harmony options enable specific features that may not yet be part of the default engine features.
